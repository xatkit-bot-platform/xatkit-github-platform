## Unreleased

### Changed

- `GithubWebhookEventProvider` now uses the new intent provider hierarchy (see [xatkit-runtime/#221](https://github.com/xatkit-bot-platform/xatkit-runtime/issues/221)). This doesn't change the public API, but requires to use the latest version of [xatkit-runtime](https://github.com/xatkit-bot-platform/xatkit-runtime).
- Headers are now matched in a case insensitive way (see [this commit on xatkit-runtime](https://github.com/xatkit-bot-platform/xatkit-runtime/commit/8217a74296cd9cee2a774204106a11dca766a29d)).

## [2.0.0] - 2019-08-20
